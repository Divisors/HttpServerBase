/**
 * <p>
 * JSON Web Token (JWT) is a compact claims representation format intended for
 * space constrained environments such as HTTP Authorization headers and URI
 * query parameters. JWTs encode claims to be transmitted as a JSON [RFC7159]
 * object that is used as the payload of a JSON Web Signature (JWS) [JWS]
 * structure or as the plaintext of a JSON Web Encryption (JWE) [JWE] structure,
 * enabling the claims to be digitally signed or integrity protected with a
 * Message Authentication Code (MAC) and/or encrypted. JWTs are always
 * represented using the JWS Compact Serialization or the JWE Compact
 * Serialization.
 * </p>
 * 
 * From <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519">RFC 7519</a>
